<h2><u>***I Am Offering Coding/Programming Lessons/Mentorship***</u></h2>
</center>
Frankly, if you want to be a good programmer, do not join any coaching, seek adivce from people who are good programmers, share ideas and learn.
<br><br>
So you may like computers, but dont quite get how to program(how everything fits in  together).
This is where I can help.
<br><br>
I can help you understand and feel the fundamentals of programming so that you can then start to write fluent code on your own WITH PRACTICE.
<br><br>
I think both as a computer and a human and thus I know how one should bridge the gap in understanding the concepts of programming.
<br><br>
I do charity, but this certainly is not one.
<br><br>
I will charge you INR 250 for 2 hrs.
(Age is not a criteria)
<br><br>
So if you think I can help you, feel free to reach out to me via :
